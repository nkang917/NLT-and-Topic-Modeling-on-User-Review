# NLT-and-Topic-Modeling-on-User-Review
•	Clustered unlabeled user reviews of a watch into groups and discovered the latent semantic structures using Python.

•	Preprocessed review text by tokenization, stemming, removing stop words and extracted features by Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).

•	Trained unsupervised learning models of K-means clustering and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

•	Identified latent topics and keywords of each review for clustering.
